## 🔒 Security Notes

### What's Secure ✅
- Private keys generated in browser
- Public key cryptography (Ed25519)
- DIDs on immutable blockchain
- HTTPS connections

### What's NOT Production-Ready ⚠️
- Keys in browser memory (lost on refresh)
- Simplified JWT handling (no real signatures)
- localStorage for sensitive data
- No revocation checking
- No proper key management

### For Production Use
1. Use **IOTA Stronghold** for key storage
2. Implement proper **JWT signing/verification**
3. Add **revocation list** checking
4. Use **mainnet** instead of testnet
5. Add **credential schemas**
6. Implement **proper authentication**

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Testnet Speed**
   - DID creation takes 10-20 seconds
   - Production mainnet would be faster

2. **Browser Refresh**
   - Private keys lost on refresh
   - Need to create new DIDs
   - Expected for this demo

3. **Simplified Verification**
   - Not verifying actual JWT signatures
   - Production needs proper verification
   - Good enough for learning

4. **No Mobile App**
   - Web-only for now
   - Could be wrapped in React Native
   - Progressive Web App potential
