4. **Verify Data Structure**

```json
// iota-dids
[
  {
    "did": "did:iota:0x...",
    "document": {...},
    "created": "2025-10-16T14:30:00.000Z"
  }
]

// iota-credentials
[
  {
    "jwt": "{...}",
    "issued": "2025-10-16T14:35:00.000Z",
    "subject": "Alice Johnson"
  }
]
```

### Test Persistence

1. Create a DID
2. Refresh the page
3. Go to "Issue Credential" tab
4. Check if the DID appears in the dropdown
5. ‚úÖ If yes, persistence works!

### Clear Storage

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: DID Creation Hangs

**Symptoms**: Button stuck on "Creating..." for > 1 minute

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Check if testnet is operational

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh page and try again
2. Try different browser
3. Wait 5 minutes and retry (testnet might be overloaded)

### Issue: Credentials Not Saving

**Symptoms**: Dropdown doesn't show previously issued credentials

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check localStorage in DevTools
2. Check browser console for errors

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure cookies/localStorage not blocked
2. Check if in private/incognito mode (storage limited)
3. Try different browser

### Issue: Copy Button Not Working

**Symptoms**: Click copy button, nothing happens

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if HTTPS (clipboard API requires secure context)
2. Check browser console for errors

**Solutions**:
1. Use localhost (counts as secure)
2. Manually select and copy text
3. Try different browser
