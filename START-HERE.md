## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Is this ready for production?
**A:** No. This is a demo/learning tool. For production, you need:
- Real blockchain writes (not mock)
- Secure key storage (IOTA Stronghold)
- Proper JWT signing
- Revocation lists
- Security audits

### Q: Can I actually use these DIDs?
**A:** The DIDs are created locally for demo purposes. In production, they would be published to the actual IOTA Tangle and be globally resolvable.

### Q: Why does DID creation take so long?
**A:** In this demo, it's instant (mock mode). Real blockchain writes would take 5-15 seconds on testnet.

### Q: Can I use this for my project?
**A:** Yes! This is open-source. Use it to learn, prototype, or as a starting point for your own DID application.
