## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Test WASM Initialization

1. **Ensure dev server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open test page in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test-wasm
   ```

3. **Run Test 1: WASM Initialization**
   - Click "Run Init Test"
   - ‚úÖ Should see: "Success! WASM initialized"
   - Check browser console for detailed logs

4. **Run Test 2: DID Creation**
   - Click "Run DID Test"
   - ‚úÖ Should see: "Client created, ready for DID operations"

### Step 2: Test DID Creation

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Import the real implementation
const { createDID } = await import('/lib/iotaIdentityReal');

// Create a DID
const result = await createDID();
console.log('DID Created:', result.did);
console.log('Key Stored:', result.keyStored);
console.log('Document:', result.document);
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ DID created: did:iota:smr:0x...
‚úÖ Private key saved (encrypted) for DID: did:iota:smr:0x...
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Components

To use real blockchain integration in your app:

#### Update Component Imports

**File: `components/FarmerOrigin.tsx`**

```typescript
// Change from:
import { createDID } from '@/lib/iotaIdentity';

// To:
import { createDID } from '@/lib/iotaIdentityReal';
```

Repeat for:
- `components/FactoryProduction.tsx`
- `components/ConsumerJourney.tsx`
- Any other components using IOTA Identity

#### Or Create a Conditional Import

**File: `lib/iotaIdentity.ts`** (update existing)

```typescript
// At the top of the file
const USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN === 'true';

// Export conditional implementation
export { createDID, issueCredential, verifyCredential, resolveDID } from 
  USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN 
    ? './iotaIdentityReal' 
    : './iotaIdentity';
```

Then in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Use real blockchain (testnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN=true

# Or use mock data (demo mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN=false
```

## üöß Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Current State:
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| DID Creation | ‚úÖ Working | Creates valid DID documents |
| DID Publishing | ‚è≥ Partial | Needs testnet tokens to publish |
| Credential Signing | ‚è≥ Partial | Structure in place, needs Storage setup |
| On-Chain Verification | ‚úÖ Working | Can verify published DIDs |
| Key Storage | ‚úÖ Working | Encrypted localStorage (demo only) |

### To Enable Full Publishing:

1. **Get Testnet Tokens:**
   ```
   Visit: https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network
   Enter address from DID
   Request free testnet tokens
   ```

2. **Implement Publishing:**
   ```typescript
   // In iotaIdentityReal.ts, update createDID():
   
   // After creating document:
   const aliasOutput = await client.publishDidOutput(
     document,
     privateKey
   );
   
   console.log('‚úÖ DID published to blockchain!');
   console.log('Transaction:', aliasOutput.transactionId);
   ```

3. **Complete Credential Signing:**
   ```typescript
   // Needs SDK Storage instance:
   const storage = new Storage.Memory();
   await storage.keyInsert(fragment, privateKey);
   
   const signed = await document.signCredential(
     credential,
     storage,
     fragment,
     new ProofOptions()
   );
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### WASM Test Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Test 1 fails with "WASM initialization failed"
- Console shows module errors

**Solutions:**
1. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`
3. Check webpack config in `next.config.ts`
4. Try Approach 2: Server-side API (see plan document)

### DID Creation Works But Can't Verify

**Symptoms:**
- DID created successfully
- Verification fails with "DID not found on blockchain"

**Cause:** DIDs are created locally but not published to blockchain

**Solution:**
1. Get testnet tokens from faucet
2. Implement publishing step (see "To Enable Full Publishing" above)
3. Or keep in demo mode with mock DIDs

### Key Storage Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to load private key" errors
- Keys not persisting between sessions

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser localStorage is enabled
2. Check console for encryption errors
3. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
4. Create new DIDs

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Hybrid Mode (Recommended)
- Keep mock data for demo
- Allow users to enable "Real Blockchain Mode"
- Toggle via environment variable
- Best for showcasing both approaches

### Option 2: Full Blockchain (Production)
- Use only `iotaIdentityReal.ts`
- Require wallet connection
- All operations on-chain
- Costs real tokens

### Option 3: Testnet Only
- Use `iotaIdentityReal.ts` with testnet
- Free tokens from faucet
- Full blockchain features
- Good for testing/development
