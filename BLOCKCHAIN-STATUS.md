# Blockchain Implementation Status

## üéØ Current Status: ~85% Complete

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- IOTA Identity SDK fully integrated
- Real DID creation with cryptographic keys
- Verifiable Credential issuance
- Encrypted key storage
- Network connection to IOTA testnet
- Complete UI with mode toggling
- Full testing suite

### ‚ùå What's Blocking
**Issue**: Cannot connect to IOTA Wallet Extension

**Why**: The wallet extension uses `postMessage` API, not `window.iota` object. Our current detection method looks for the wrong API.

**Impact**: Cannot pay storage deposit ‚Üí Cannot publish DIDs to blockchain

---

## üîß What Needs To Be Done

### Option 1: Use IOTA Wallet SDK (Recommended)
**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Difficulty**: Medium

```bash
npm install @iota/wallet
```

Then implement proper SDK-based wallet connection (see `docs/onchain/BLOCKCHAIN-COMPLETION-PLAN.md` for full code)

### Option 2: Use Server-Side API
**Time**: 1-2 days  
**Difficulty**: High

Create Next.js API routes that handle wallet operations on the server side.

### Option 3: Use Firefly Wallet
**Time**: 3-5 hours  
**Difficulty**: Medium

Integrate with Firefly's API for wallet operations.
