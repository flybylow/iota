## 🚀 What's Next

### Immediate (High Priority)

**Transaction Building for Blockchain Publishing**

The infrastructure is ready, but to complete actual blockchain submission:

1. **Build proper IOTA SDK transaction object**
   - Use `AliasOutputBuilder` from @iota/iota-sdk
   - Add state metadata with DID document
   - Set proper unlock conditions
   - Calculate storage deposit

2. **Submit via signAndExecute()**
   ```typescript
   signAndExecute(transaction, {
     onSuccess: (result) => {
       console.log('Published:', result.id);
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Requirements**
   - Proper transaction object format
   - Storage deposit calculation
   - Valid unlock conditions
   - Wallet-compatible format

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Full Cryptographic Signing**
   - Complete Ed25519 signing implementation
   - On-chain signature verification

2. **Credential Revocation**
   - Revocation registry
   - On-chain revocation checks

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Mainnet configuration
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance monitoring
