# 🎯 Next Steps - Quick Reference

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete, Ready for Milestone 2

---

## ✅ JUST COMPLETED

- ✅ All integration tests passing
- ✅ IOTA testnet migration
- ✅ Local DID creation working
- ✅ Committed to `feature/simple-onchain` branch
- ✅ 80% blockchain-ready

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### **To Continue Development:**

```bash
# You're on the right branch
git branch  # Should show: feature/simple-onchain

# Continue from here:
# See MILESTONE-2-BLOCKCHAIN-INTEGRATION.md
```

### **To Demo the App:**

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
# Check tests: http://localhost:3000/integration-test
```

### **To Test Blockchain Mode:**

1. Click settings icon (top right)
2. Switch to "Blockchain Mode"
3. Try creating a DID
4. (Will create locally - needs wallet for publishing)

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| WASM Init | ✅ Working | All tests pass |
| DID Creation | ✅ Local only | Ready for blockchain |
| Credentials | ✅ Working | Issue & verify |
| Wallet | ❌ Not connected | Needs implementation |
| Publishing | ❌ Framework only | Needs wallet |

**Overall:** 80% complete, blockchain-ready

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### **You Have Testnet Tokens!**
- Address: `0xd175...b3c1`
- Balance: 20 IOTA
- Network: Testnet ✅

### **What Works:**
- All tests passing
- Local DID creation
- Credential operations
- Mode switching

### **What Needs Work:**

## 💡 HACKATHON STRATEGY

### **Recommended Approach:**

**Demo Script:**
1. Show integration tests (all ✅)
2. Demonstrate mode toggle (Demo ↔ Blockchain)
3. Explain architecture (blockchain-ready)
4. Show code (`lib/iotaIdentityReal.ts`)
5. Mention: "Architecture ready, wallet integration remaining"

**Key Points:**
- ✅ All infrastructure done
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Blockchain-ready architecture
- ✅ 20% remaining (wallet integration)
- ✅ Clear implementation plan

---

## 🎉 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED

**You've built:**
- ✅ Working blockchain-ready DPP app
