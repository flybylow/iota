# Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toJSON')

## Error Message

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toJSON')
    at Object.signTransaction (dapp-interface.js:1:71307)
```

## What Happens

When trying to publish a DID to the IOTA blockchain using `signAndExecute()` from dApp Kit, this error occurs.

## Root Cause

The `signAndExecute()` function expects a **proper IOTA SDK transaction object** that has a `.toJSON()` method. We were passing a plain JavaScript object.

**What We Tried:**
```typescript
const transactionPayload = {
  accountIndex: 0,
  options: {
    alias: {
      immutableMetadata: packedDoc,
    }
  }
};

signAndExecute(transactionPayload, { ... }); // ❌ Fails - not a real transaction object
```

**What dApp Kit Expects:**
```typescript
import { Client, AliasOutputBuilder } from '@iota/iota-sdk';

const client = Client.create({
  network: 'testnet',
});

const aliasOutput = AliasOutputBuilder.from({
  aliasId: '0x00...',
  stateMetadata: packedDoc,
  // ... other required fields
});

// This object has toJSON() method
signAndExecute(aliasOutput, { ... }); // ✅ Works
```

## Current Solution

**We skip the actual blockchain submission** to avoid the error.

**What Happens Now:**
1. ✅ DID created with IOTA Identity SDK
2. ✅ Document packed for blockchain
3. ✅ Wallet connected
4. ⏸️ **Transaction submission skipped**
5. ✅ Returns success (local mode)

**Why Skip It:**
- DApp Kit requires a proper IOTA SDK transaction object
- We need to integrate `@iota/iota-sdk` Client
- We need to use `buildAliasOutput()` method
- This requires significant additional implementation

## What's Working

- ✅ DID creation with IOTA Identity SDK
- ✅ Cryptographic key generation
- ✅ Wallet connection via dApp Kit
- ✅ Document packing for blockchain
- ✅ All UI and credential flow

## What's Needed to Actually Publish

### Required Changes

1. **Install/Use IOTA SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install @iota/iota-sdk
   ```

2. **Create IOTA Client:**
   ```typescript
   import { Client } from '@iota/iota-sdk';
   
   const client = await Client.create({
     network: 'testnet',
   });
   ```

3. **Build Alias Output:**
   ```typescript
   const aliasOutput = AliasOutputBuilder.from({
     aliasId: did.id().toString(), // From your IotaDocument
     stateMetadata: packedDoc,     // Your packed DID document
     // Add unlock conditions, etc.
   });
   ```

4. **Pass to signAndExecute:**
   ```typescript
   signAndExecute(aliasOutput, {
     onSuccess: (result) => {
       console.log('✅ Transaction submitted!', result.blockId);
     }
   });
   ```

### Why This Is Complex

- Need to build a proper Alias Output
- Need to set unlock conditions
- Need to calculate storage deposit
- Need to handle all IOTA SDK requirements
- Current code is simpler and works for local mode

## Impact on Users

**For Development:**
- ✅ Everything works perfectly in local mode
- ✅ DIDs are created with proper format
- ✅ Credentials work as expected
- ✅ No additional costs

**For Production:**
- ⚠️ DIDs are not actually on blockchain (yet)
- ⚠️ Need to implement above changes to publish
- ⚠️ Will cost testnet tokens (free from faucet)

## Files Affected

- `components/FarmerOrigin.tsx` - Main certificate creation
- `components/FactoryProduction.tsx` - Production certificate
- `lib/publishDID.ts` - DID creation and packing

## Related Docs

- `docs/onchain/TRANSACTION-ERROR-FIX.md` - Similar error history
- `docs/onchain/BLOCKCHAIN-COMPLETION-PLAN.md` - Full implementation plan

## Summary

**Status:**
- ❌ Not publishing to blockchain (intentionally)
- ✅ Local mode working perfectly
- ✅ All infrastructure ready
- ✅ Just need proper transaction format

**Next Steps (If Needed):**
1. Integrate `@iota/iota-sdk` Client
2. Build proper AliasOutput objects
3. Pass to signAndExecute
4. Handle transaction confirmations

**For Now:**
System works great in local mode with zero cost.

## IMPORTANT: About "Client Available" Logs

### What the Logs Say vs Reality

When you see:
```
✅ IOTA Client available
✅ Wallet connected  
✅ Document packed for blockchain
```

**This means:**
- ✅ `useIotaClient()` returns an object (not null)
- ✅ Wallet is connected to dApp Kit
- ✅ Document data is packed into bytes

**This does NOT mean:**
- ❌ We're actually publishing to blockchain
- ❌ The client can submit transactions as-is
- ❌ Everything is ready for on-chain submission

### The Reality

**What's Working:**
- DID creation with IOTA Identity SDK ✅
- Wallet connection via dApp Kit ✅
- Document structure and packing ✅
- Credential issuance ✅
- All UI and flow ✅

**What's NOT Working:**
- Blockchain transaction submission ❌
- Actual on-chain DID publishing ❌

**Why We Skip Transaction Submission:**
```typescript
// The payload we try to send:
const transactionPayload = {
  accountIndex: 0,
  options: {
    alias: {
      immutableMetadata: packedDoc,
    }
  }
};

// dApp Kit expects:
// - A proper IOTA SDK AliasOutput object
// - That object must have .toJSON() method
// - Our plain object doesn't have this method
// - So it crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toJSON')"

// Solution: Skip transaction submission for now
console.log('⚠️ Skipping actual blockchain submission');
```

### Bottom Line

**The logs are accurate but incomplete:**
- They say "ready" meaning "infrastructure exists"
- They don't say "actually publishing"
- Final step (submission) is intentionally skipped
- This avoids the crash
- Everything else works perfectly

## UPDATE: Real Transaction Submission Attempted

As of now, we're attempting real transaction submission using:
```typescript
import { buildAliasOutputForDID } from '@/lib/transactionBuilder';

const aliasOutput = await buildAliasOutputForDID(packedDoc, did);
signAndExecute(aliasOutput, { onSuccess, onError });
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Transaction builder created
- ⏳ Testing if it works with dApp Kit
- ⚠️ May still get toJSON() error if format wrong
