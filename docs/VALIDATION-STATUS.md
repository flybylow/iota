# Validation Status

## Current Validation: Basic Only

The comment `//For this demo, we're doing basic validation` means:

### What We're Currently Doing ✅
- ✅ Structural validation (checking fields exist)
- ✅ Format validation (W3C credential structure)
- ✅ Date checks (expiration validation)
- ✅ Field presence checks

### What We're NOT Doing ❌
- ❌ Cryptographic signature verification
- ❌ On-chain DID resolution
- ❌ Public key extraction from DID documents
- ❌ JWT signature validation

### Why It's "Basic"
Because we can't fully verify credentials without:
1. **Published DIDs on blockchain** - DIDs are created locally but not published yet
2. **Public key extraction** - Need to fetch DID document to get issuer's public key
3. **Cryptographic verification** - Need the public key to verify JWT signature

### The Full Verification Process Would Be:

```typescript
// 1. Resolve DID from blockchain
const didDocument = await resolveDID(credential.issuer);

// 2. Extract public key
const publicKey = extractPublicKeyFromDID(didDocument);

// 3. Verify JWT signature
const isValidSignature = verifyJWT(credential, publicKey);
```

### Current Status

**Structural Validation:** ✅ Working  
**Cryptographic Verification:** ⏳ Pending (requires blockchain-published DIDs)

### To Enable Full Verification

1. Publish DIDs to blockchain
2. Implement DID resolution from blockchain
3. Extract public keys from DID documents
4. Implement JWT signature verification
5. Check signature against issuer's public key

**This is expected behavior** - the infrastructure is ready, but we're doing structural validation since full cryptographic verification requires published DIDs.
