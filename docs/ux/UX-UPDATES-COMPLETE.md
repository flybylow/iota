## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Simplified Flow
```
Before: Create DID → Issue Credential → Verify Credential
After:  Create Identity → Verify Identity
```

### 2. Confetti Celebration 🎉
- Triggers on successful DID creation
- 100 particles, 70° spread
- Makes success memorable

### 3. Progressive Loading
```
⚡ Generating cryptographic keys...
📄 Creating identity document...
🌐 Publishing to IOTA network...
✓ Waiting for confirmation...
```

### 4. Plain Language
- "Create Your Digital Identity" (not "Create Decentralized Identity")
- "Think of it like an email address" (relatable analogy)
- "What you just did" summaries

### 5. Quick Actions
- "📋 Use My Identity" button
- "🔗 Use Example" DID
- Auto-navigation after create

### 6. Side-by-Side Comparison
- Traditional (❌ slow, centralized)
- Decentralized (✅ fast, global)
- Visual contrast

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimizations

- **Touch Targets:** 48px minimum height
- **Text Size:** Locked at 16px (prevents zoom)
- **Responsive:** Grid stacks on mobile
- **Padding:** Reduced on small screens
- **Scroll:** Smooth, no horizontal overflow

## 🎨 Layout Specifications

### Home Page Layout
- **Desktop Max Width:** 800px (`max-w-md md:max-w-[800px]`)
- **Mobile Max Width:** 448px (matches container)
- **Centered:** All content centered with `mx-auto`
- **Carousel:** Also constrained to 800px max width for consistency
- **Responsive Breakpoint:** 768px (md)

This ensures the entire home page, including the credit card carousel, stays within a readable 800px width on desktop screens while remaining fully responsive on mobile devices.
