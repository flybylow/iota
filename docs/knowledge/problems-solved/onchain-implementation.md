# On-Chain Implementation - IOTA Identity

**Date**: October 2025  
**Category**: Blockchain, IOTA, DID Publishing  
**Complexity**: Hard  
**Time to Solve**: Ongoing (framework complete)

---

## Context

Implementing real blockchain integration for DID creation and publishing to IOTA Tangle, moving from demo mode (localStorage) to blockchain mode.

---

## The Problem

Moving from mock implementation to real blockchain integration requires:
- Real DID creation with cryptographic keys
- Publishing DID documents to IOTA Tangle
- Wallet integration for transactions
- Key management and security
- Network connectivity handling

**Initial Blockers**:
- No working faucet for testnet tokens
- Wallet API integration needed
- Storage deposit requirements
- Network connection handling

---

## Your Original Prompt

"Implement real blockchain mode using IOTA Identity SDK for DID publishing and credential management."

---

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: SDK Integration (Complete)
```typescript
// lib/iotaIdentityReal.ts
export const createDID = async () => {
  const sdk = await initSDK();
  const keyPair = sdk.KeyPair.fromPrivateKey('...');
  const did = await sdk.DID.new(keyPair);
  return did;
};
```

### Step 2: Key Storage (Complete)
```typescript
// lib/keyStorage.ts
export const storeKey = async (keyId: string, privateKey: string) => {
  const encrypted = await encrypt(privateKey);
  localStorage.setItem(`key_${keyId}`, encrypted);
};
```

### Step 3: Network Client (Complete)
```typescript
// lib/iotaClient.ts
export const checkConnection = async () => {
  try {
    const client = new ClientBuilder()
      .network('shimmer')
      .node('https://api.testnet.shimmer.network')
      .build();
    await client.getInfo();
    return { connected: true };
  } catch (error) {
    return { connected: false, error };
  }
};
```

### Step 4: DID Publishing (Framework Ready)
```typescript
// lib/didPublishing.ts
export const publishDID = async (did: string) => {
  // Framework implemented
  // Requires: wallet + tokens for full implementation
  return { published: false, reason: 'Needs wallet integration' };
};
```

---

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Phased Approach**: Framework ready, can be completed when resources available
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to demo mode if blockchain unavailable
3. **Secure Key Management**: AES encryption for private keys
4. **Network Awareness**: Checks connectivity before operations
5. **Mode Toggle**: User controls demo vs blockchain

---

## Code Pattern

```typescript
// Complete implementation pattern
export const issueCredential = async (
  subject: string,
  credentialType: string,
  claims: any
) => {
  // 1. Initialize SDK
  const sdk = await initSDK();
  
  // 2. Get or create issuer DID
  const issuerDID = await getOrCreateDID('issuer');
  
  // 3. Create credential (structure ready)
  const credential = {
    issuer: issuerDID.toString(),
    type: credentialType,
    credentialSubject: claims,
    expirationDate: new Date(Date.now() + 31536000000).toISOString(),
  };
  
  // 4. Store locally (ready for blockchain signing)
  await storeCredential(credential);
  
  return credential;
};
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Complete
- Local DID creation
- Key generation and storage
- Credential structure creation
- UI integration (mode toggle)
- Test infrastructure
- Error handling

### ⚠️ Framework Ready
- DID publishing (needs wallet + tokens)
- Full cryptographic signing (needs deeper SDK integration)
- On-chain verification (needs published DIDs)

## Cross-Project Applicability

- **aigo**: Blockchain integration patterns could be reused
- **Any Identity Project**: DID/VC patterns are reusable
- **Blockchain Apps**: Wallet integration patterns

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Full Blockchain First**: ❌ Too complex, blocks demo
2. **Separate Apps**: ❌ Adds complexity
3. **Server-Side Only**: ❌ Not aligned with client needs
4. **Current Approach**: ✅ Gradual migration with fallback

---

## Key Learnings

1. Start with framework, complete when resources available
2. Local storage bridge allows demo → blockchain migration
3. Wallet integration is separate concern from DID creation
4. Test infrastructure essential for blockchain features
5. User experience > technical perfection

- [ ] Implement full Ed25519 signing
- [ ] Add DID resolution from blockchain
- [ ] Implement credential revocation
- [ ] Add storage deposit handling
- [ ] Complete on-chain verification
