# ðŸ“š Project Knowledge Base

**Purpose**: Track important prompts, problems solved, and learnings for this project and cross-project reference.

**Structure**:
- `cross-project/` - Learnings from other projects (like aigo)
- `problems-solved/` - Key problems we've solved here
- `prompts/` - Important prompts and their outcomes

## Quick Access

### Recent Problems Solved

## How to Use This

When we solve a problem:
1. Document it in `problems-solved/`
2. Tag it with relevant categories
3. Update the index if it's a key learning

When working on something similar:
1. Check this index first
2. Look at cross-project references
3. Reuse patterns that worked
