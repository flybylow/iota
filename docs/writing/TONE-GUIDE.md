# Tone & Voice Guide

**Project:** IOTA DID Demo  
**Audience:** Non-technical users, students, product managers  
**Goal:** Make decentralized identity approachable and clear

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Friendly & Approachable**
- Use conversational language
- Explain technical concepts with simple analogies
- Avoid intimidating jargon

**✅ Good:**
- "A permanent identity that you own forever."
- "Verify the identity is real, active, and correctly signed."
- "Think of it like creating an email address..."

**❌ Avoid:**
- "Generate a cryptographic keypair and publish to the distributed ledger"
- "Decentralized identifier utilizing W3C standards"
- Corporate/defensive language ("no company can take away")

### 2. **Clear & Concise**
- Short sentences
- One idea per sentence
- Remove unnecessary words

**✅ Good:**
- "Takes ~5 seconds"
- "Free on testnet"

**❌ Avoid:**
- "This process will take approximately 5 seconds to complete"
- "There are no fees associated with testnet usage"

### 3. **Positive & Empowering**
- Focus on what users CAN do
- Celebrate successes
- Use encouraging language

**✅ Good:**
- "Identity Created Successfully! ✨"
- "You own it forever"
- "Ready for the next step?"

**❌ Avoid:**
- Negative framing ("won't be stolen", "can't be hacked")
- Fear-based messaging
- Overly technical warnings

### 4. **Visual & Scannable**
- Use emojis sparingly for visual anchors
- Break text into small chunks
- Use checkmarks and bullets

**✅ Good:**
```
✓ You own forever
✓ Works everywhere
✓ Anyone can verify
```

**❌ Avoid:**
- Long paragraphs
- Wall of text
- Too many emojis (emoji soup)

## 📝 Writing Patterns

### Headlines
**Format:** Emoji + Action/Benefit

```

### Descriptions

```
✅ "A permanent identity that you own forever."
✅ "Verify the identity is real, active, and correctly signed."
```

### Buttons
**Format:** Emoji + Verb + Noun
```
✅ "🚀 Create Identity"
✅ "🔐 Verify Identity"
✅ "📋 Use My Identity"
```

### Loading States
**Format:** Emoji + Present continuous verb + object
```
✅ "⚡ Generating cryptographic keys..."
✅ "📄 Creating identity document..."
✅ "🌐 Publishing to IOTA network..."
```

### Success Messages
**Format:** What just happened + What it means
```
✅ "Created a permanent digital identity"
✅ "It's now published on IOTA network"
✅ "Anyone in the world can verify it"
```

## 🚫 What to Avoid

### 1. **Negative Framing**
❌ "No company can take it away"  
✅ "You own it forever"

❌ "Won't be hacked"  
✅ "Cryptographically secure"

### 2. **Corporate Speak**
❌ "Leverage decentralized infrastructure"  
✅ "Use a permanent identity"

❌ "Utilize cryptographic verification"  
✅ "Verify with math"

### 3. **Defensiveness**
❌ "Unlike traditional systems that can fail..."

## 🎨 Emoji Usage

### When to Use
- **Headlines:** One emoji at start
- **Buttons:** One emoji at start
- **Status indicators:** ✅ ❌ ⚡ ✓
- **Visual anchors:** Helps scanning

### When NOT to Use
- Multiple emojis in a row (🎉✨🚀)
- In long paragraphs
- As replacements for words
- More than 2-3 per screen section

**Good balance:**
```
🆔 Create Your Digital Identity

🤔 What is this?

```

## 📊 Comparison Language

### Traditional vs Decentralized

**Tone:** Factual, not aggressive

**✅ Good:**
```
Traditional: Call company
Decentralized: Instant verification
```

**❌ Avoid:**
```
Old way: Slow and broken
New way: Fast and amazing
```

Keep it:
- Neutral
- Factual
- Let the facts speak

## 💬 Example Rewrites

### Before → After

**Too technical:**
> "Generate a new DID and publish it to the IOTA Tangle using Ed25519 keypairs"

**Better:**
> "Create a permanent identity that you own forever."

---

**Too long:**
> "Before trusting a product, supplier, or claim - verify the identity is real, active, and correctly signed."

**Better:**
> "Verify the identity is real, active, and correctly signed."

---

**Negative framing:**
> "No company controls it, it can't be taken away, and nobody can revoke it"

**Better:**
> "You own it forever."
