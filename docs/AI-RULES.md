# AI Collaboration Rules

**Purpose**: Define how to collaborate with AI on this project.

---

## Rule 1: Code Work First ⚡

**"Always do code work first so we can see results fast and documentation afterwards"**

### Priority Order:
1. Working code implementation
2. Basic functionality testing
3. Documentation and comments
4. Optimization and polish

### Rationale:
- Fast iteration cycles
- Immediate feedback
- Rapid prototyping

### Practice:
- Implement features before writing docs
- Make it work first, make it perfect later
- Test in browser to see actual results

---

## Rule 2: No Code Yet (NCY) 🚫

**"Do not write code before I say so"**

### When NCY is active:
- Provide plans, specifications, and documentation only
- Ask clarifying questions
- Research and analyze requirements
- Create mockups or wireframes
- Explain approaches without implementing

### When NCY is lifted:
- Implement immediately
- Focus on working code over perfect code
- Iterate based on results

### Purpose:
Prevent premature implementation before requirements are clear.

---

## Rule 3: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) 🎯

**"Try to go to the basics and build from there, no need for long titles and explanations, get to the core"**

### Core Principles:
- Start with basics, build up from there
- Short, clear titles and descriptions
- Focus on essential functionality first
- Avoid over-engineering or complex explanations
- Get straight to the point

### Implementation:
- Simple interfaces over complex ones
- Essential features before nice-to-haves
- Clear, direct communication
- Minimal viable solutions

### Examples:
- Remove verbose explanatory text
- Focus on core POC flow
- Don't add marketing copy
- Let the demo speak for itself

---

## Rule 4: Documentation Rule 📝

**"When I use (), add definition to abbreviations doc and : (dox) docs"**

### Abbreviations:
When user uses parentheses with abbreviations like "(NCY)":
- Add the abbreviation and definition to this document
- Include context and usage examples

### Documentation format:
When user uses `: (dox)` format:
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Follow the established documentation structure
- Include examples and cross-references

### Purpose:
Maintain knowledge repository as project evolves.

## Development Checklist

Before considering a task complete:

- [ ] Code works before documenting
- [ ] Browser-first implementation
- [ ] Import/export functionality
- [ ] Error handling included
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] KISS principles applied (simple, core functionality)
- [ ] New abbreviations added to this document
- [ ] Documentation updated when using : (dox) format

---

## Abbreviations

### NCY
**No Code Yet** - Status indicating AI should provide plans/specs only, not implement code until instructed.

### KISS
**Keep It Simple, Stupid** - Principle of simplicity, avoiding over-engineering, focusing on core functionality.

### DX
**Developer Experience** - The experience developers have when using tools, frameworks, or APIs.

## When Stuck

1. **Re-read these rules** - Apply Code First, KISS
2. **Check existing code** - Look at similar patterns
3. **Test in browser** - Actual behavior > assumptions
4. **Ask for clarification** - Better questions than wrong assumptions
5. **Start simple** - Build from basics, add complexity later

---

## Key Principles

1. **Code First, Docs After** - Working code is more valuable than perfect documentation
2. **KISS Principle** - Simplicity over complexity, core features over nice-to-haves
3. **Interactive > Static** - Real inputs and calculations beat placeholder data
4. **Phase-by-Phase** - One feature at a time, tested and complete before next
