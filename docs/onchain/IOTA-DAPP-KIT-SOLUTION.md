# IOTA dApp Kit Integration - Solution Implemented

## Problem Solved ✅

**Original Issue:** Wallet connection failing with error "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."

**Solution from Discord:** Use `@iota/dapp-kit` instead of custom `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` approach.

**Result:** Wallet connection now works perfectly!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Installed dApp Kit
```bash
npm install @iota/dapp-kit
# Peer dependencies already present:
# - @iota/iota-sdk@1.6.1
# - @tanstack/react-query@5.90.5
```

### 2. Added Providers
Created `components/Providers.tsx` with:
- `QueryClientProvider` (React Query)
- `IotaClientProvider` (IOTA network configuration)
- `WalletProvider` (Wallet Standard API)

### 3. Replaced Wallet Connection
- **Old:** Custom `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` with hardcoded extension ID
- **New:** `<ConnectButton />` from `@iota/dapp-kit`

### 4. New Hooks Created
- `lib/hooks/useWalletStatus.ts` - Get wallet connection state
- `lib/hooks/useDIDPublishing.ts` - Framework for DID publishing

### 5. Build Fixes
- Created `components/SpeedInsightsWrapper.tsx` for Next.js 15 compatibility
- Moved dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to client component

## Benefits

✅ **No hardcoded extension IDs** - Automatic detection  
✅ **Wallet Standard API** - Works with any compliant wallet  
✅ **Better error handling** - Built-in UI components  
✅ **Standards compliant** - Following IOTA best practices  
✅ **Easier to maintain** - Official dApp Kit maintained by IOTA team  

## Files Changed

- `components/Providers.tsx` (NEW)
- `components/SpeedInsightsWrapper.tsx` (NEW)
- `app/layout.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `components/ModeToggle.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `lib/hooks/useWalletStatus.ts` (NEW)
- `lib/hooks/useDIDPublishing.ts` (NEW)
- `lib/wallet-connection.ts` (DEPRECATED - kept for reference)

## Usage

### For Users
1. Install IOTA Wallet extension (or any Wallet Standard wallet)
2. Open app in Blockchain Mode
3. Click "Connect IOTA Wallet" button
4. Wallet modal appears for connection
5. DIDs are now created with wallet integration

### For Developers
```typescript
// Check wallet status
import { useWalletStatus } from '@/lib/hooks/useWalletStatus';

const { isConnected, address } = useWalletStatus();

// Use ConnectButton component
import { ConnectButton } from '@iota/dapp-kit';

<ConnectButton
  connectText="Connect Wallet"
  connectedText={`Connected: ${address}`}
/>
```

## Migration Notes

The old `lib/wallet-connection.ts` file has been deprecated but kept for reference. 
New code should use:
- `useWalletStatus()` hook for connection state
- `ConnectButton` component for UI
- `useDIDPublishing()` hook for DID publishing (when fully implemented)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fully implement DID publishing with dApp Kit transaction signing
- [ ] Test on-chain credential publishing
- [ ] Update documentation for production deployment
