# Route Working - Debugging Proxy Response

## Status: ✅ ROUTE HANDLER IS WORKING!

From terminal logs:
```
🟢 [IOTA Proxy Root] ========================================
🟢 POST request received to /api/iota
🟢 URL: /api/iota
🟢 Full URL: http://localhost:3000/api/iota
🟢 This is the ROOT route handler
🟢 ========================================

[IOTA Proxy Root] POST /api/iota -> https://api...
```

**Confirmed**: Route handler is being called and starting the proxy.

## Current Issue

The route handler runs but the SDK still receives 404. This suggests:
1. ✅ Route is matched correctly
2. ✅ Handler executes
3. ❓ Proxy fetch to IOTA API might be failing
4. ❓ Response handling might be incorrect

## Enhanced Debugging Added

Added detailed logging to track:
- Request body preview
- Fetch success/failure
- Response status and headers
- Response data preview
- Final response being returned

## Next Steps

When you try again, check terminal logs for:
- `✅ Response received` - Confirms fetch succeeded
- `Response status: XXX` - What IOTA API returned
- `Response data preview` - First 200 chars of response
- `Returning response with status: XXX` - What we're sending back

If IOTA API returns 400/500, that's the issue.
If IOTA API returns 200 but SDK gets 404, response handling is wrong.
