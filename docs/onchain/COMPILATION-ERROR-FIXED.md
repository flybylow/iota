# Compilation Error Fixed - Variable Name Conflict

## Problem

Route file was failing to compile with error:
```
Module parse failed: Identifier 'fullUrl' has already been declared (72:14)
```

## Root Cause

In `app/api/iota/[...path]/route.ts`, the variable `fullUrl` was declared twice:
1. Line 48: `const fullUrl = request.nextUrl.href;` (for incoming request URL)
2. Line 102: `const fullUrl = searchParams ? ...` (for target URL to proxy to)

## Solution

Renamed the first variable to `requestFullUrl` to avoid conflict:
- Line 48: `const requestFullUrl = request.nextUrl.href;` (incoming request)
- Line 102: `const fullUrl = searchParams ? ...` (target URL)

## Status

✅ **Fixed**: Variable name conflict resolved
✅ **Route should compile**: Next.js should now recognize the route

## Next Steps

The route should now work. The 404 error was caused by the route not compiling, so Next.js couldn't recognize it.

After the fix, the route should:
1. Compile successfully
2. Be recognized by Next.js
3. Handle POST requests to `/api/iota`
4. Proxy to IOTA API successfully
