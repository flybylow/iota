# Deep Analysis: Why 404 Persists Despite Route Handler Working

## Known Facts

1. ‚úÖ **Route handler IS being called** - Terminal shows logs:
   ```
   üü¢ [IOTA Proxy Root] POST request received to /api/iota
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Route file compiles** - No compilation errors

3. ‚ùå **SDK still receives 404** - Error persists

## Possible Causes

### Theory 1: IOTA API Endpoint is Wrong
- We're proxying to `/api/core/v2/blocks` but this might not exist
- IOTA SDK might use a different API structure
- **Test**: Check what endpoint IOTA API actually expects

### Theory 2: Response from IOTA API is 404
- Our proxy forwards the request correctly
- IOTA API returns 404 (invalid request format/endpoint)
- We forward that 404 to the SDK
- **Test**: Check terminal logs for "Response status: 404"

### Theory 3: SDK Expects Different URL Structure
- SDK might append paths to base URL: `/api/iota` ‚Üí `/api/iota/subpath`
- We handle `/api/iota` but SDK POSTs to `/api/iota/something`
- **Test**: Check what exact URL SDK is requesting

### Theory 4: Response Not Being Returned Properly
- Route handler executes but doesn't return response correctly
- Next.js might be returning default 404
- **Test**: Check if our proxy function returns a response

## Critical Questions

1. **What status code does IOTA API return?**
   - Check terminal logs for: `Response status: XXX`

2. **What exact URL is SDK requesting?**
   - Check browser Network tab or add logging

3. **Is our proxy function returning a response?**
   - Verify `return new NextResponse(...)` is reached

4. **What does IOTA API actually expect?**
   - Check IOTA SDK documentation for correct endpoint format

## Next Debugging Steps

1. Add network logging in browser DevTools to see exact request URL
2. Check terminal for full proxy logs including IOTA API response
3. Verify IOTA API endpoint format from official docs
4. Test if IOTA API root URL (`https://api.testnet.iotaledger.net`) accepts POST
