# Blockchain Publishing: SUCCESS! ‚úÖ

## What Just Happened

We successfully submitted a real transaction to the IOTA testnet!

### Transaction Details
- **Block ID**: `J1XA6HLRN2T6jwoKy851vys5r9xzBx6tRhWvcHBSLqaD`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Success
- **Network**: IOTA Testnet
- **Explorer**: https://explorer.iota.org/txblock/J1XA6HLRN2T6jwoKy851vys5r9xzBx6tRhWvcHBSLqaD?network=testnet
- **Cost**: 0.001 IOTA (~$0.000001)
- **From**: 0x843d‚Ä¶f9f6 (your wallet)
- **Timestamp**: October 28, 2025 at 20:53

### What We Solved

#### The Problem
Getting `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toJSON')` when trying to submit transactions.

#### The Solution
1. **Imported Transaction**: `import { Transaction } from '@iota/iota-sdk/transactions'`
2. **Created Transaction object**: `const tx = new Transaction()`
3. **Passed to signAndExecute**: `signAndExecute({ transaction: tx }, { onSuccess, onError })`
4. **Captured block ID**: From the response object

#### The Key Insight
dApp Kit's `signAndExecute()` needs an SDK `Transaction` object with `.toJSON()` method, not a plain JavaScript object.

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Working:**
- Transaction submission to blockchain
- Real block ID generation
- Explorer link generation
- Wallet connection
- Transaction signing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Work:**
- Transaction currently empty (no DID document attached)
- Need to add the DID metadata to the transaction before submission
- Currently creates DID documents but doesn't include them in transactions

### What Needs To Be Done Next

To actually publish DID documents:

1. **Add DID data to transaction**
   - Build alias output with metadata
   - Attach packed DID document
   - Use proper transaction commands

2. **Example approach:**
   ```typescript
   const tx = new Transaction();
   // Add the DID document metadata
   tx.add({
     kind: 'MoveCall',
     target: 'package::module::function',
     arguments: [packedDIDDocument],
   });
   ```

3. **Or use SDK client**
   - Use IotaClient to build proper alias outputs
   - Include unlock conditions and metadata
   - Submit complete DID document

### Proof It Works

View your transaction on the IOTA Explorer:
https://explorer.iota.org/txblock/J1XA6HLRN2T6jwoKy851vys5r9xzBx6tRhWvcHBSLqaD?network=testnet

### Cost Analysis

Transaction submitted successfully for only 0.001 IOTA (essentially free for testing).

## Achievement Unlocked: Real Blockchain Publishing! üéâ

You're now submitting real transactions to the IOTA testnet. The infrastructure works. The next step is adding DID document data to the transactions.
