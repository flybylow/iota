# Critical Insight: Route Working But SDK Gets 404

## The Puzzle

✅ Route handler IS executing (logs prove it)  
❌ SDK still receives 404 error  
❓ Why?

## Analysis

The route handler runs, but the SDK gets 404. This means:

### Possibility 1: IOTA API Returns 404
- Our proxy forwards request to IOTA API
- IOTA API returns 404 (endpoint doesn't exist)
- We forward that 404 to the SDK
- **Solution**: Find correct IOTA API endpoint

### Possibility 2: Response Not Returned
- Route handler executes but doesn't return response
- Next.js defaults to 404
- **Solution**: Ensure `return new NextResponse(...)` is executed

### Possibility 3: Response Format Wrong
- We return response but in wrong format
- SDK doesn't recognize it
- **Solution**: Match exact response format SDK expects

## What We Need

**Check terminal logs for**:
```
[IOTA Proxy Root] Response status: XXX
```

This will tell us:
- If status is 200 → IOTA API accepted request, issue is response handling
- If status is 404 → IOTA API rejected request, wrong endpoint
- If status is 400/500 → IOTA API error, wrong request format

## Action Required

Please share the COMPLETE terminal output when you try submitting a transaction, especially:
1. All lines starting with `[IOTA Proxy Root]`
2. The "Response status:" line
3. Any error messages

This will reveal whether the issue is:
- Wrong IOTA API endpoint ❌
- Response handling issue ❌  
- Request format issue ❌
