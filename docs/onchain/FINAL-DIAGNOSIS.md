# Final Diagnosis: Route Working But 404 Persists

## Confirmed Facts

✅ **Route handler executes** - Terminal logs prove it  
✅ **Route compiles** - No errors  
✅ **File structure correct** - `app/api/iota/route.ts` exists  
❌ **SDK still receives 404**

## The 404 Source

The 404 must be coming from **IOTA API**, not Next.js.

### Evidence
1. Route handler logs appear (route works)
2. Request reaches handler
3. Handler attempts to proxy
4. SDK receives 404

### Hypothesis
IOTA API returns 404 because:
- Wrong endpoint format
- Wrong request format  
- Missing required headers
- Invalid request body

## Debugging Required

**Check terminal for these specific logs:**
```
[IOTA Proxy Root] ✅ Response received
[IOTA Proxy Root] Response status: XXX  <-- KEY LINE
```

- If status = 200 → IOTA API accepted, our response handling wrong
- If status = 404 → IOTA API rejected, wrong endpoint  
- If status = 400 → IOTA API rejected, wrong request format

## Next Action

**Please check your terminal and share:**
1. The complete output when transaction is submitted
2. Specifically the line: `Response status: XXX`
3. Any error messages from the proxy

This will reveal if:
- ✅ IOTA API endpoint is wrong
- ✅ Request format is wrong
- ✅ Response handling is wrong
