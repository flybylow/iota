# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED: Network Corrected

## What Happened

Based on Discord feedback from **Dr.Electron (IOTA Foundation)**:

> "Why are you using Shimmer? This is an IOTA hackathon"

**You were using the wrong network!** ❌

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed: Shimmer Testnet → IOTA Testnet

| Item | Old (Wrong) | New (Correct) |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Network | Shimmer | **IOTA** ✅ |
| API Endpoint | `api.testnet.shimmer.network` | `api.testnet.iotaledger.net` |
| Network ID | `'smr'` | `'iota'` |
| Faucet | Down (shimmer) | **Available (iota)** 🎉 |
| Hackathon | ❌ Wrong | ✅ **Correct** |

---

## 🎯 What This Means

### Before
- ❌ Wrong network for IOTA hackathon
- ❌ Could fail validation/judging

- ❌ Incorrect DIDs generated

### After
- ✅ **Correct network for IOTA hackathon**
- ✅ **Proper hackathon compliance**
- ✅ **IOTA faucet should work!**
