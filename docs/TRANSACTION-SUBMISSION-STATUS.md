# Transaction Submission Status

## Current Error

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')
```

## Problem

We're trying to use `Client.create()` from `@iota/iota-sdk` but:
1. The import path might be wrong
2. The API might have changed in v1.6
3. We should use dApp Kit's `useIotaClient()` instead

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Using @iota/iota-sdk Client
```typescript
import { Client } from '@iota/iota-sdk/client';
const client = await Client.create({...}); // ❌ Error
```

### Attempt 2: Using dApp Kit's Client Hook
```typescript
// In component
const client = useIotaClient(); // ✅ Works
```

## Current Solution

**We're skipping the transaction submission** because:
- Can't get the SDK Client to work properly
- dApp Kit's `signAndExecute` format is unclear
- No clear examples of DID publishing with dApp Kit

**What works:**
- ✅ DID creation
- ✅ Wallet connection
- ✅ Document packing
- ✅ Everything else

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Actually submitting to blockchain
- ❌ Getting transaction ID
- ❌ Explorer links

## Next Steps (If We Want Real Blockchain)

### Option 1: Use dApp Kit Properly
Research the correct dApp Kit API for alias transactions

### Option 2: Use IOTA Wallet SDK
Use `@iota/wallet` instead of dApp Kit for submission

### Option 3: Keep It Local
Accept that blockchain publishing is complex and keep it local for demo

## Recommendation

**Keep it local for now** until we have clear documentation on:
1. How to use dApp Kit's `signAndExecute` with alias transactions
2. What payload format it expects
3. How to get transaction IDs back

This is a legitimate limitation - blockchain integration is complex.
