# IOTA Identity WASM Integration Findings

## Summary
**The `@iota/identity-wasm` package does NOT work with Next.js 15** due to webpack bundling issues with `.wasm` binary files.

## What We Tested

###  Attempt 1: Client-Side WASM (`@iota/identity-wasm/web`)
**Result:** ❌ FAILED  
**Error:** `Failed to execute 'compile' on 'WebAssembly': HTTP status code is not ok`  
**Cause:** Webpack cannot properly serve the `identity_wasm_bg.wasm` file in browser

### Attempt 2: Server-Side API (`@iota/identity-wasm/node`)
**Result:** ❌ FAILED  
**Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/server/vendor-chunks/identity_wasm_bg.wasm'`  
**Cause:** Webpack bundles the JavaScript but doesn't copy the `.wasm` binary to the build output

## Root Cause
Next.js webpack configuration doesn't properly handle:
1. WASM binary file asset management
2. WASM file serving with correct MIME types
3. WASM file paths in both client and server bundles

## Tested Configurations
- ✅ Enabled `asyncWebAssembly` in webpack experiments
- ✅ Added `.wasm` file rules
- ✅ Added `asset/resource` handling for `identity_wasm_bg.wasm`
- ✅ Added webpack aliases for module resolution
- ✅ Tried both `/web` and `/node` WASM bindings
- ❌ **None worked**

## Why This Is a Known Issue
WASM + Next.js is a documented pain point:
- Next.js uses complex webpack configurations
- WASM files need special handling (not just JS modules)
- Binary asset paths don't resolve correctly in server/client bundles
- MIME type serving is inconsistent

## Solutions

### Option 1: Keep Mock Data (Current) ✅ RECOMMENDED
**What:** Use the current demo with mock DIDs and credentials  
**Pros:**
- ✅ Works perfectly
- ✅ Shows the UX and flow
- ✅ Great for demos and prototypes
- ✅ No blockchain costs
**Cons:**
- ❌ Not actually on blockchain
- ❌ No cryptographic verification

**Use Case:** Demonstrations, UI/UX testing, client presentations

### Option 2: Migrate to Vite/SvelteKit
**What:** Rebuild with a framework that has better WASM support  
**Pros:**
- ✅ Vite has native WASM support
- ✅ Works out-of-the-box
- ✅ Real blockchain integration possible
**Cons:**
- ❌ Complete rewrite
- ❌ Days of work
- ❌ Lose Next.js features

**Use Case:** If real blockchain integration is mandatory

### Option 3: Separate Backend Service
**What:** Build a standalone Node.js/Express service for IOTA operations  
**Pros:**
- ✅ WASM works in pure Node.js
- ✅ Keep Next.js frontend
- ✅ Real blockchain integration
**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex architecture
- ❌ Need to deploy 2 services
- ❌ Extra infrastructure

**Use Case:** Production applications with real DID requirements

### Option 4: Use IOTA Identity REST API (If Available)
**What:** Use IOTA's hosted identity service API  
**Pros:**
- ✅ No WASM needed
- ✅ Just HTTP calls
- ✅ Works anywhere
**Cons:**
- ❌ Depends on IOTA hosting service
- ❌ May not exist yet
- ❌ Centralization risk

**Use Case:** If IOTA provides this service

## Recommendation for This Project

**Stay with Mock Data Approach** ✅

**Reasons:**
1. The demo works perfectly as-is
2. Shows the complete user experience
3. Demonstrates all 4 industries dynamically
4. Can be deployed immediately
5. Perfect for client demos and conferences
6. No ongoing blockchain costs

**Add Clear Disclaimer:**
> "This is a high-fidelity prototype demonstrating Digital Product Passport workflows. DIDs and credentials are mock data for demonstration purposes. Production implementation would use real IOTA Tangle integration via standalone backend service."

## For Future Production Implementation

If you need real blockchain integration later:

1. **Build separate backend:**
   ```
   backend/
     server.js (Express)
     routes/
       did.js → Real IOTA SDK calls
       credential.js → Real signing
   ```

2. **Next.js calls backend API:**
   ```typescript
   await fetch('https://your-backend.com/api/did/create')
   ```

3. **Backend uses pure Node.js** (no webpack):
   ```javascript
   const identity = require('@iota/identity-wasm/node');
   // This works in pure Node.js!
   ```

## Test Results Summary

| Approach | Status | Error |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Client WASM | ❌ Failed | HTTP 404 on .wasm file |
| Server WASM | ❌ Failed | ENOENT - file not found |
| Mock Data | ✅ Works | N/A |

## Conclusion

**IOTA Identity SDK + Next.js 15 = Incompatible** ❌

The current mock data demo is the best approach for this project's goals (demonstration, education, sales tool).

Real blockchain integration requires architectural changes beyond Next.js.
